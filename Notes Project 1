Definition of excess morality: "a term used in epidemiology and public health that refers to the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis above and beyond what we would have expected to see under ‘normal’ conditions." Checchi, F., & Roberts, L. (2005). Interpreting and using mortality data in humanitarian emergencies. Humanitarian Practice Network, 52.
Excess mortality is a more comprehensive measure of the total impact of the pandemic on deaths than the confirmed COVID-19 death count alone. -> https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid?country=IND~USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~FRA
